•	Difficulty 1: Statically Sized Sliding Window: Find maximum (or minimum) sum subarray of desired size in a given array.
•	Difficulty 2: Dynamically Sized Sliding Window: Given an array of positive integers, find the contiguous subarray of integers that add up to a given number.
o	Variation: Same question but for an array with all integers (positive, 0, negative). The optimum solution is Kadane's Algorithm, but the sliding window technique is still ok.
•	Strings: Given a string and n letters, find the shortest substring that contains all given letters.
•	Flipping/Swapping: Find the maximum sequence of continuous 1's that can be formed by replacing at-most k 0's by 1's.
